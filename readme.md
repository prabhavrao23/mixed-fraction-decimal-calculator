Fraction Calculator Web Interface
Project Overview
This project provides a convenient web-based application for performing arithmetic operations on fractions. It features a robust C++ backend that handles the core mathematical logic for fraction calculations, seamlessly integrated with a user-friendly frontend built using Python Flask.

The calculator supports various input formats for numbers, including simple fractions, mixed numbers, decimals, and whole numbers, making it versatile for different use cases.

‚ú® Features
Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (√ó), and division (√∑) of fractions.

Flexible Input Formats: Supports 1/2, 2_1/3, 1.25, and 3.

Command-Line Interface (C++): The core calculation engine can also be run directly from your IDE or terminal.

Web-Based User Interface (Python Flask):

Simple and intuitive interface for calculations.

Responsive design for easy use across devices.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites/How to run on your computer
A C++ Compiler (GCC/G++ recommended): For compiling the C++ backend.

Python 3: For running the Flask frontend.

Flask: The Python web framework.

1. Clone the Repository (or ensure all files are in one directory)
Make sure all project files (app.py, templates/, fraction_cli.cpp, Fraction.h, Fraction.cpp, README.md) are in a single directory on your computer.

2. Compile the C++ Backend
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory (e.g., C:\your-fraction-calculator-repo), and compile the C++ source code:

Bash

g++ fraction_cli.cpp Fraction.cpp -o fraction_cli.exe
This command will create the executable fraction_cli.exe (on Windows) or fraction_cli (on Linux/macOS) in your project directory.

3. Run the Python Flask Frontend
Install Flask: If you haven't already, install Flask using pip:

Bash

pip install Flask
Start the Flask application: From your project directory in the terminal, run:

Bash

python app.py
You will see output indicating that the Flask server is running, typically on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Access the Web Interface: Open your web browser and go to the address provided by Flask (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
