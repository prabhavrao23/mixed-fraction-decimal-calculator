# Mixed-fraction-decimal-calculator with web interface

## Project Overview

I made this project to be able to perform arithmetic operations on mixed fractions and decimals. I did this through operator overloading with a C++ backend and Python Flask frontend. 

## Demo Video

The calculator supports various input formats for numbers, including simple fractions, mixed numbers, decimals, and whole numbers.

## Features

- Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท) of any number. 
- Flexible Input Formats: Supports 1/2, 2_1/3, 1.25, and 3.
- Command-Line Interface (C++): The core calculation engine can also be run directly from your IDE or terminal.
- Web-Based User Interface (Python Flask):  
  Simple and intuitive interface for calculations.

## Prerequisites/How to run on your computer

- A C++ Compiler (GCC/G++ recommended): For compiling the C++ backend.
- Python 3: For running the Flask frontend.
- Flask: The Python web framework.

1. Clone the Repository 

2. Compile the C++ Backend

3. Run the Python Flask Frontend  
   
4. Access the Web Interface:  
Open your web browser and go to the address provided by Flask (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
